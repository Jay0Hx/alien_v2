<h1 align="center">Information</a></h1>

***NOTE:*** I am working on making this read-me acuratly represent the menu, the menu is not completed yet so some features listed are not present.

I have scanned the file before working on it for virus's etc and it's clean, but feel free to do it yourself. original creators link can be found below (if this is wrong let me know so I can update it!) I take no credit for the creation of the original program, please give the proper credit to the original creator linked above! I have only added some, what i feel, are needed adjustments for making race days slightly easier with regards to changing your vehicles values.  

Please take note, I have only tested the pre-defined engine modes using F1 cars because that is mainly what I play with! Let me know how you get on using my version of AlienV2 with differnt cars, I would appreciate any feedback on options that you would like to see added!

<h1 align="center">Features </a></h1>  

***'Flash Maps' Menu:***  
In this section you will find a list of pre-made maps for both speed and drivetrain, these maps have been tested using F1 style cars and are known to be as close to perfect as I can make. The auto-pilot feature will work with these flash maps meaning if you want to quickly catch up in a race, enable your desired flash map then enable auto-pilot. Gearbox maps override any current data you have on your manual gearbox tune.

***'Manual Tuning' Menu:***  
In this tab you will see options on manually tuning your vehicle in real time, please note that the 'Flash Map' options will override any options that you chose in the 'Manual Tuning' menu. There is a reset button included in each sub-section to automatically reset each section to the default should you wish too.

***'Drivers' Menu:***  
This menu lists all the current connected drivers to your session, click on each name to view a list of options such as spectate and teleport! This feature will 100% get you banned from servers with active admins but as far as I know you will not recieve a game ban as it uses functions that are built into the game. The 'Drivers' tab will also give you information such as the drivers lap positions, location and what car they are driving.

<h1 align="center">Changes that I made</a></h1>

+ Added '*Quick Map*' options (This is a new tab that introduces 'maps' with pre-defined vaules for power etc...)  
+ I've compiled some things like power and handling under the same menu for easier use.   
+ I have added an 'Auto Win' feature, this will use the already excisting AI + my maps feature to automatically win the race.  
+ There is now a 'mapping' option for gear ratios, similar to my power mode selection but this is pre-defined gear ratios

<h1 align="center">Installation Guide</a></h1>
